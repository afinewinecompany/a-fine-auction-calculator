## Executive Summary

Auction Projections by A Fine Wine Company solves the real-time inflation problem that plagues fantasy baseball auction drafts. While managers enter drafts with pre-calculated player values, these projections become obsolete the moment bidding begins. As players are drafted above or below their projected values, inflation dynamics shift - yet managers are left doing mental math or guessing at adjusted values for remaining players.

Our solution integrates directly with Couch Managers draft rooms to automatically pull live auction data, eliminating manual input entirely. The app provides managers with two critical insights at a glance: (1) how much each drafted player deviated from their projection, and (2) how that inflation is dynamically affecting the auction values of all remaining undrafted players.

What sets us apart is our sophisticated inflation modeling that accounts for the unique challenge of fantasy baseball auctions - where 2000+ players have projected values but only ~800 will actually be drafted. This expertise in auction dynamics combined with real-time calculation speed creates a competitive advantage that's difficult to replicate.

The result: managers gain unprecedented visibility into draft dynamics, enabling them to identify undervalued opportunities and make informed bidding decisions throughout the entire draft.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Fantasy baseball auction drafts present a dynamic pricing problem that existing tools fail to address. Managers enter drafts with static player projections, but as the auction progresses and players are purchased above or below their projected values, inflation (or deflation) occurs across the entire remaining player pool. Currently, managers resort to mental math and guesswork to estimate these real-time adjustments, leading to poor draft decisions, overpayment for players, and missed value opportunities.

### Problem Impact

Without accurate inflation tracking, managers are fundamentally unprepared for the evolving draft landscape. They cannot accurately assess what remaining players should cost, leading to:

- **Overpaying for players** when inflation is running hot
- **Missing steals** when players go for unexpectedly low prices
- **Poor roster construction** due to misallocated budget across positions
- **Mental fatigue** from attempting complex calculations during high-pressure bidding moments
- **Competitive disadvantage** against managers who better understand real-time market dynamics

This problem affects all managers in slow auction drafts, though analytics-focused and serious competitors feel the pain most acutely as they recognize the gap between their preparation and execution.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current auction draft tools provide static pre-draft projections but fail to adjust these values during live drafts. While these tools help with preparation, they offer no solution for the dynamic pricing challenge that emerges once bidding begins.

The primary reason this gap exists is the complexity and manual burden required to track inflation in real-time. Existing solutions would require managers to manually input every auction result and recalculate values on the fly - an impossible task during fast-paced draft moments. No tool has successfully tackled the specific inflation adjustment problem because it requires both sophisticated modeling and seamless data integration.

### Proposed Solution

Auction Projections by A Fine Wine Company integrates directly with Couch Managers draft rooms to automatically pull live auction values as players are drafted. The app continuously recalculates inflation based on actual vs. projected spending, then dynamically adjusts the auction values of all remaining undrafted players.

The interface provides managers with immediate, actionable insights:

1. **Variance tracking**: Clear visualization of how much each drafted player went for relative to their projection (overpaid/steal)
2. **Inflation-adjusted values**: Real-time updated auction values for all remaining players based on current draft dynamics
3. **Zero manual input**: Automatic data sync from Couch Managers eliminates the need for manual entry during the draft

The solution's power lies in its sophisticated inflation modeling algorithm that accounts for the unique challenge of fantasy baseball auctions - accurately modeling inflation when only ~800 of 2000+ projected players will actually be drafted.

### Key Differentiators

**Technical Superiority:**
- Sophisticated inflation modeling that handles the complex dynamics of partial player pool drafting (2000 projections → 800 drafted)
- Real-time calculation speed that provides instant updates as each player is drafted
- Automatic Couch Managers integration eliminating manual data entry burden

**Domain Expertise:**
- Deep understanding of fantasy baseball auction dynamics and inflation mechanics
- Accurate projection methodology tuned specifically for auction format nuances

**Competitive Moat:**
- Inflation algorithm sophistication creates a technical barrier to entry
- Real-time performance requirements make replication challenging
- Integration complexity with Couch Managers draft platform

**User Experience:**
- At-a-glance insights designed for high-pressure draft moments
- Zero-friction usage requiring no manual input during live drafts
- Actionable intelligence (not just data) that directly informs bidding decisions

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**The Competitive Fantasy Baseball Manager**

Our primary user is the experienced fantasy baseball manager who competes in mid-to-high level auction draft leagues. With 5-30 years of fantasy baseball experience across multiple leagues, these managers are sophisticated players who invest significant time in draft preparation. They arrive at drafts armed with their own carefully crafted auction projections, representing hours of research, player analysis, and strategic planning.

**Context & Environment:**
- Participates in multiple competitive fantasy baseball leagues annually
- Drafts from a mix of laptop and mobile devices, often switching between platforms during lengthy auction sessions
- Operates in a high-pressure environment where split-second bidding decisions can make or break their season
- Values data-driven decision making but struggles with real-time calculation complexity during live drafts

**Current Problem Experience:**
During live auctions, these managers face an impossible mental challenge. As players are nominated and bid prices deviate from projections, they attempt to recalculate inflation impacts in their heads while simultaneously tracking remaining roster needs, budget constraints, and positional scarcity. The workaround is trusting gut instinct and hoping their mental math is close enough—a frustrating compromise for managers who pride themselves on analytical rigor.

The anxiety peaks when high-tier players start going above projection. They know this triggers a cascade effect: if premium players are inflating, mid-tier and low-tier players will inflate even more. They desperately try to factor in positional scarcity (how many elite shortstops remain?) while the auction clock ticks down. The mental burden becomes overwhelming, leading to decision paralysis or costly mistakes.

**Success Vision:**
Success means securing needed players without overpaying—making informed bids based on accurate, inflation-adjusted values rather than outdated projections or guesswork. The "aha!" moment comes early in the draft when they see the first wave of nominations complete and immediately understand how those results are affecting inflation across all remaining players. Instead of frantically calculating, they glance at their screen and instantly know which players represent value and which are overpriced.

**What Makes This Indispensable:**
Two features become non-negotiable: (1) automatic integration with their Couch Managers draft room, eliminating any manual data entry burden during the high-pressure draft environment, and (2) real-time inflation-adjusted values showing exactly what each remaining player should cost given current draft dynamics. The convenience of saved league links means they simply open the app and start drafting—no setup friction between them and actionable intelligence.

The ultimate value: understanding positional inflation dynamics at a glance. Seeing how many elite players remain at each position and how inflation is hitting different tiers differently gives them the competitive edge they've been missing. This transforms them from reactive bidders hoping they're making smart decisions into informed strategists who can confidently identify undervalued opportunities while their competitors operate in the dark.

### Secondary Users

N/A - This product focuses exclusively on individual fantasy baseball managers participating in auction drafts.

### User Journey

**Discovery:**
Managers discover Auction Projections through word-of-mouth recommendations and endorsements from trusted fantasy baseball influencers. Given the competitive nature of these leagues, credibility and proven results matter—managers adopt tools that demonstrably provide an edge.

**Onboarding:**
First-time users land on a straightforward interface prompting them to log in and create their league profiles. The app allows them to save multiple leagues for future reference, anticipating the reality that most serious managers participate in several leagues simultaneously. The setup is intentionally minimal—these users want to spend time drafting, not configuring tools.

**First Draft - The Aha! Moment:**
The critical moment arrives after the initial nomination round completes. Users watch as 5-10 players are nominated and sold, then glance at the app. Instantly, they see how those actual bid prices are affecting projected values for all remaining players. The inflation calculation they'd been attempting mentally is now automatic and accurate. They realize they have information their competitors lack—a tangible competitive advantage in real-time.

**Return & Retention:**
What brings managers back for their next draft is the combination of convenience and proven value. Saved league links mean one-click access to their draft room integration. The at-a-glance interface becomes muscle memory—they know exactly where to look to see which players are undervalued or overpriced relative to current inflation. After experiencing a draft where they had superior information, reverting to gut-feel bidding feels like fighting blindfolded.

**Long-Term Usage:**
Across multiple leagues and seasons, Auction Projections becomes part of their essential draft toolkit—as fundamental as their projection spreadsheets and player rankings. The tool proves its value repeatedly: helping them avoid overpays during hot bidding, capitalizing on deflated markets when early spending is conservative, and maintaining composure when draft dynamics shift unexpectedly. It transforms auction anxiety into auction confidence.
